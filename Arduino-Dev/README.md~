This repository is to house some of my adventures in embedded development.  I am working on some Arduio projects, am about to start some dev with IAR and ARM cortex based boards made by TI.  Also in the works is Development with RTOS systems and FPGA.  I am currently taking a coerce on Real Time Systems and additionally just purchased the Digilent Zybo FPGA board.  Check each sub folder for more details in each topic.  Much more to come...
