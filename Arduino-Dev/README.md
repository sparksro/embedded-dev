This folder is for Arduino dev files.  The first project is aimed at building a temprature sensor and heat coil controller.  I will be using the DHT-11 sensor that senses both temp and humdidity.  In later progress I will switch to the DHT-22 sensor as it is more accurate.  Code peices will be added in steps so that if you are refferencing this you can follow the progression.

Folder:
1.  basis_lcd_hello_world  :code to send hello world to 16 x 2 lcd
2.  DHT_ll : header files necessary for the dht11 to function.
3.  dhtll_temp_humidity: code to read the sensor and report the data back and print to serial out.
