This folder is for Arduino dev files.  The first project is aimed at building a temperature sensor and heat coil controller.  I will be using the DHT-11 sensor that senses both temp and humidity.  In later progress I will switch to the DHT-22 sensor as it is more accurate.  Code pieces will be added in steps so that if you are referencing this you can follow the progression.

Folder:1.  DHT_ll, -Header files necessary for the dht11 to function.
Folder:2.  basic_lcd_hello_world, -Code to send hello world to 16 x 2 LCD.
Folder:3.  dht11_temp_humidity, -Code to read the sensor and print data to serial out.
Folder:4.  dhtll_temp_and_humidity_printed_to_LCD, -Code to read the sensor and print data to 16 x 2 LCD screen
