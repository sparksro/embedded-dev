This folder is for ARM dev files. I found a very good, quite detailed set of tutorials on youtube at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V9eqvkMzHA&list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM 
that I will be following along with, and developing on an ARM M4 Cortex based board using IAR IDE and 
emulation environment. The board I am using is slightly different than the one he is using.  I am using
a TI TM4C123GXL and he uses I beleive is a TI TM4C120x but so far every thing is pretty much the same and
the one I have he has linked in course matterials.

This course spends a significant amount of time at the low level and, if you choose to follow along, 
will help you understand exactly whats going on so that when you are developing at the high level 
you have a much better understanding. This file will contain the code thatI type up as well as my 
notes as comments.  There is no copy paisted code here.  Please in no way considerthis to be complete 
representaion of the course nor will I claim to cover all the detailed points he covers in my notes and 
while I strive for complete accuracy there again is not garuntee.  Please follow his videos to gain that 
level of detail.  In most cases I am very verbose in my comments and often will not stay exactly to the 
code as he types is as I like to play and experiment.  My intentent is not to beshort and to the point 
but to write details that might help you and will certainly aid in my retention. Additinally I only include the 
main file for that lesson not the entire project for IAR. All files have been renamed from main to the lesson 
number.  With all that, if you enjoy it and it helps you feel free to use it as you wish.
 
There are a large number of lessons to add to this file as of this writing.  In the future this will also serve
as a place to store other simular type code and class files as I persue enbedded development topics.
